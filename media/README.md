   - **Mean**: 3.05
   - **Standard Deviation**: 0.76
   - **Minimum**: 1
   - **Maximum**: 5
   - **Distribution Percentiles**: 25% (3.0), 50% (3.0), 75% (3.0)
   - **Missing Values**: 0

   The overall rating is fairly evenly distributed around a mean of 3, suggesting moderate satisfaction or quality across the dataset. There is limited variability, as indicated by the standard deviation.

7. **Quality Rating**
   - **Count**: 2652
   - **Mean**: 3.21
   - **Standard Deviation**: 0.80
   - **Minimum**: 1
   - **Maximum**: 5
   - **Distribution Percentiles**: 25% (3.0), 50% (3.0), 75% (4.0)
   - **Missing Values**: 0

   The quality rating is slightly higher than the overall rating, illustrating that items might have more favorable quality perceptions than their general ratings.

8. **Repeatability**
   - **Count**: 2652
   - **Mean**: 1.49 (indicates an average frequency of revisits)
   - **Standard Deviation**: 0.60
   - **Minimum**: 1
   - **Maximum**: 3
   - **Distribution Percentiles**: 25% (1.0), 50% (1.0), 75% (2.0)
   - **Missing Values**: 0

   The repeatability suggests that most entries are not frequently revisited, with an average of around 1.5.

### Missing Values Summary
- The missing values are mostly concentrated in the 'by' attribute, with 262 missing entries.
- Other attributes are complete, which is conducive to analysis and interpretation.

### Correlation Analysis
The correlation between the different rating metrics shows:
- **Overall vs. Quality**: Strong positive correlation (0.83), indicating that as overall ratings increase, quality ratings also tend to increase.
- **Overall vs. Repeatability**: Moderate positive correlation (0.51), suggesting that more frequently revisited entries tend to have better overall ratings.
- **Quality vs. Repeatability**: Weaker positive correlation (0.31), indicating that quality ratings have less impact on repeat visits.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
- The dataset is rich in content, particularly movies in English, with Kiefer Sutherland being a notable contributor.
- The overall and quality ratings suggest moderate satisfaction, but exploration of factors causing the missing contributor data in 'by' could enhance insights into the dataset's comprehensiveness.
- The strong correlation between overall and quality ratings indicates that initiatives to improve quality could positively impact overall ratings.
- A deeper analysis could involve exploring trends over time by date, looking into quality versus language if certain languages yield better ratings, or segmenting by types to examine distribution and satisfaction across different genres. 

Overall, the dataset supports various explorations into viewer satisfaction, contributions, and potential genre trends within the assessed content.
